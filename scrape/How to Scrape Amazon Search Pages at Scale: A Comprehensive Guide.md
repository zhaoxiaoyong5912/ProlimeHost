## Scraping Amazon Search Pages with ScraperAPI

### Step 1: Fetch the Page Content
Start by sending a request to the Amazon search page using ScraperAPI:
```python
from scraper_api import ScraperAPIClient

client = ScraperAPIClient('YOUR_API_KEY')
response = client.get('https://www.amazon.com/s?k=gaming+mouse')
if response.status_code == 200:
    print(response.text)
```

### Step 2: Handle Dynamic Content
Amazon uses dynamic loading for product information. ScraperAPI automatically handles JavaScript rendering, ensuring you get the fully loaded page.

### Step 3: Extract Product Data
Use libraries like BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract specific information:
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
products = soup.find_all('div', {'class': 's-main-slot'})
for product in products:
    title = product.find('span', {'class': 'a-size-medium'}).text
    print(title)
```

---

## Handling Pagination

Amazonâ€™s search results span multiple pages. To scrape all results, loop through the pagination:
```python
page = 1
while True:
    url = f'https://www.amazon.com/s?k=gaming+mouse&page={page}'
    response = client.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        break
    # Extract data...
    page += 1
```

---

## Save Data to CSV
After extracting the product data, save it to a CSV file for analysis:
```python
import pandas as pd

data = [{'title': 'Product 1', 'price': '$19.99'}, {'title': 'Product 2', 'price': '$25.99'}]
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv('amazon_products.csv', index=False)
```
