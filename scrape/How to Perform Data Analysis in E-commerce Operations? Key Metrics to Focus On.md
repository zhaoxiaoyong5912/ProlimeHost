## 1. High Traffic Acquisition Costs

In the fiercely competitive e-commerce market, the cost of acquiring new users continues to rise. Advertising expenses, search engine optimization (SEO), and social media marketing require substantial investments, yet the outcomes may not always be proportional. By leveraging data analysis, businesses can optimize their ad placements, target specific audiences more effectively, and extract insights from user behavior to boost ad conversion rates.

## 2. Low Conversion Rates

Despite high traffic volumes, a low percentage of visitors completing purchases results in inefficient sales. Through user behavior analysis, businesses can identify the root causes of low conversion rates, such as poor user experience, inaccurate product positioning, uncompetitive pricing, or lackluster marketing campaigns. Addressing these pain points by improving website design, refining product displays, adjusting pricing strategies, and creating compelling promotional activities can significantly enhance conversion rates.

## 3. Unstable Sales Performance

E-commerce sales are influenced by a variety of factors, including market demand fluctuations, seasonal trends, competitor strategies, and product lifecycle changes. These complexities lead to unpredictable sales performance, which impacts inventory management, cash flow, and operational strategies. Building sales forecasting models, analyzing historical data, and keeping abreast of market trends can help predict future sales. Additionally, conducting market research and adjusting products and marketing strategies promptly can mitigate uncertainties.
