## Getting Started with Crawlee

### Quick Setup

The fastest way to start with Crawlee is by using the **Crawlee CLI**. This automatically installs dependencies and sets up boilerplate code for you.

```bash
npx crawlee create my-crawler
cd my-crawler
npm start
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer integrating Crawlee into your existing project, hereâ€™s how to do it. Youâ€™ll also need **Playwright** to enable browser-based crawling.

```bash
npm install crawlee playwright
```

Below is an example of using the `PlaywrightCrawler` to scrape web pages:

```javascript
import { PlaywrightCrawler, Dataset } from 'crawlee';

// Initialize the crawler
const crawler = new PlaywrightCrawler({
    async requestHandler({ request, page, enqueueLinks, log }) {
        const title = await page.title();
        log.info(`Title of ${request.loadedUrl} is '${title}'`);

        // Save the scraped data
        await Dataset.pushData({ title, url: request.loadedUrl });

        // Enqueue additional links
        await enqueueLinks();
    },
});

// Start crawling
await crawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev']);
```
