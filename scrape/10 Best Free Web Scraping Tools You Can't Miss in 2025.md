## What Is Web Scraping and How Is It Used?

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites using specialized bots. This technique allows users to obtain vast amounts of structured data quickly and efficiently. Tools like **Regex (Regular Expressions)** are often used to clean and organize the data during the scraping process.

### How Web Scraping Works

1. **Simulating User Behavior:** A web scraping bot simulates human browsing by sending requests to a website and retrieving information in the form of HTML files.
2. **Parsing HTML:** Once the HTML source code is obtained, the bot locates and extracts the desired data using specific commands.
3. **Cleaning and Structuring Data:** The scraped data is cleaned, organized, and made ready for download or transfer to a database.
